What is similarity between Function and Procedure :-

*	Both are the stored object, both are stored 
	in database in compiled format  .
*	There is a system table for both so the entire
	code of both is stored over there.   
*	Both of them are global. 
*	They can be called form anywhere.
*	Both of them can have parameters.
*	Both of them ,they can't be overloaded.
*	You can't have two procedure and function
	with the same name.






What is Difference between Function and Procedure :-


*	Procedure can have IN , OUT , INOUT parameter , whereas in 
	case of function , funct have only IN parameter.

*	Procedure does not return value unless you call by reference(pass OUT/INOUT parameter) , 
	whereas in case of function , funct return value directly and compulsorily.


*	In the case of procedure , procedure can be called by itself.
	But funct cannot be called by itself.
	(bocz funct return a value and that value has to be store somewhere)
	Hence, funct has to be equated with a variable.( like  set @x = abc(); ) OR
	it part of some expression.(like  sal = sal + abc(); )

*	STORED FUNCTIONS CAN BE CALLED IN SELECT STATEMENT.  	
	STORED FUNCTION CAN BE CALLED IN DML COMMANDS ALSO   
							     	
	Select abc(10) from dual;			     
	Select abc(sal) from emp;
