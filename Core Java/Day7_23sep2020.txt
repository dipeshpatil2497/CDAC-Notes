Polymorphism : -
---------------------

*	One Entity use for multiple purpose.

*	Compiler time Polymorphism OR early Binding OR 
	Static Binding :-
	-- Binding of function call with function at compile		
	     time , that is Compiler  time Polymorphism.

*	RunTime Ploymorphism OR Late Binding OR 
	Dynamic Binding OR Dynamic Method Dispitch : -
	-- Binding of function call with function at runtime		
	     time , that is Run time Polymorphism.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method Hiding : -
---------------------  

*	Superclass Method hinding subclass Method and vice versa.
*	Method is called on the basis of reference variable
	instead of Calling on basis of Object.

*	We can achieve Method hinding with 
	STATIC METHOD Only.	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL : -
---------

*	Its keyword to finalise things.

*	final variable : - constant variable.

	final method : - constant method 
		             (cannot override final method in subclass)

	final class : - constant class
		        (cannot extends/inhrits final class in subclass)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABSTRACTION : -

*	Hinding internal things and showing only essential
	things.	

*	To achieve Abstraction using "Abstract class" And "Interface".

*	Abstarct class : -
	1. Using abstract class we can achieve abstraction.
	2. Abstract class can have abstract method or concreate method or both.
	     (abstract method :- method declear with abstract keyword before method)
	     (concreate method : - this a normal method has we create normally. )
	3. Abstract class cann't be instantiated(cannot create object) 


*	Interface : 
	A way to achieve abstraction in java
	-- interface cannot  be instantiated
	-- if any class inherites any interface then class
	    must override all abstract method of the interface.
	-- it makes multiple inheritance poosible 

	-- all interface methods are by default abstract
	     and public.
	     e.g. public abtract void show ();

	-- all variables declear inside interface  are bydefault 
	      public static final known as name constant.
	      e.g.  public static final float pi = 3.14F;


*	Different between Abtraction and interface : -
	-- multiple inheritance is used in interface not in abtraction.
